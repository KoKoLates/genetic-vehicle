# genetic-vehicle
A simulation of autonomous in artificial neural network with genetic algorithm and model predictive control.

## Todo Lists
* code refactor
    * using `json` file to store configure, pattern (traffic) and weights
    * current storage is on local storage, but can add on local
    * modularize for neural network, environment (like road) and each vehicle (both main and dummy).
* model predictive control system can be done first.
* migration to `react.js` with node.js (not browser at all). and using typescript for more strick format (the mirgraion can be through more).

## Reference
* [DOM canvas]()
* [file structure suggest](https://github.com/christopher4lis/canvas-boilerplate/tree/master/src)
